# Creating Dye Molecules (`create_dye`)

## Purpose

`create_dye` creates and parameterizes a reusable dye component. It writes molecular and force-field files for an uncapped dye residue, optionally into the dye library configured by `libraries.dye_dir`.

## What the Workflow Does

PyeDNA attaches temporary cap atoms to the mapped dye core, embeds a 3D conformer, writes SDF/PDB structures, optimizes the capped geometry, computes an electrostatic potential, and performs two-stage RESP charge fitting. It then extracts the uncapped core atoms into a final residue MOL2, creates missing GAFF parameters with `parmchk2`, writes a `.attach` file containing the final linker attachment atom names, and checks that the MOL2 charge is close to the target formal charge of the dye.


## Prerequisites

- PyeDNA runtime configuration with `amber.ambertools_home` pointing to an AmberTools installation that provides `antechamber`, `respgen`, `resp`, and `parmchk2`.
- RDKit and PySCF available in the Python environment.
- Optional: CuPy and GPU4PySCF available in the Python environment for GPU-accelerated PySCF steps when a CUDA device is visible to the process.
- `libraries.dye_dir` set when `output.directory = "library"`.

## User Input Required

**Required:** dye name, dye code or residue name, mapped dye core SMILES, cap SMILES, and cap target atom-map IDs.

> **Important Input: `core_smiles` and `cap_targets`**
>
> Note that `PyeDNA` requires feeding a `core_smiles` string that descibes the chemical structure of the *uncapped* dye molecule that is getting atatched to the DNA, even if that means the structure is not chemically sound, i.e. at the attachment points of the linker molecule a bond is missing, see in the attached example structure, where the attachment points are the two `N` atoms.
> **Important**: Note that we index these atoms with `1` and `2` in `core_smiles`, which is important because these indices appear in `cap_targets`, giving the required information which atoms need to be capped for the geometry optimization and charge fitting procedure.

**Example (`core_smiles`)**
```smiles
CC1(C)C2=CC=CC=C2[N:1]/C1=C\C=C\C(C3(C)C)=[N+:2]C4=C3C=CC=C4
```

> **Important Input: `cap_smiles`**
>
> The `cap_smiles` strings (e.g. -$\mathrm{H}$ or -$\mathrm{CH_3}$ as SMILES strings) are required to chemically saturate `core_smiles` dye structure and actually mimic the electronic environment if attached linker chain. 



## Minimal Configuration Example For `dye.toml`

```toml
[component]
type = "dye"
name = "Cy3"
code = "CY3"

[structure]
core_smiles = 'CC1(C)C2=CC=CC=C2[N:1]/C1=C\C=C\C(C3(C)C)=[N+:2]C4=C3C=CC=C4'
cap_smiles =  'C'
cap_targets = [1, 2]
formal_charge = 1

[parameterization]
charge_method = "resp"
forcefield = "gaff2"

[output]
directory = "cwd"
cleanup = "scratch"
```

The SMILES above is only a syntax example. The mapped atoms and chemistry must be chosen for the actual dye.

## Configuration Reference

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[component].type` | optional | `"dye"` | Must be `"dye"` if supplied. |
| `[component].name` | required | none | Base name for generated files and intermediate capped molecule. |
| `[component].code` | optional for current-directory output; required for library output | `name` is used as residue name when omitted | Final residue name and library directory identifier. |
| `[structure].core_smiles` | required | none | RDKit-readable dye core SMILES. At least one atom-map ID must be present. |
| `[structure].cap_smiles` | required | none | RDKit-readable cap fragment. Current validation supports exactly one cap atom. |
| `[structure].cap_targets` | required | none | Unique atom-map IDs in `core_smiles`; one cap is attached to each target. `core_targets` is accepted as a legacy alias. |
| `[structure].formal_charge` | optional | formal charge inferred from core SMILES | Target charge for the uncapped dye RESP group and final residue charge check. |
| `[parameterization].charge_method` | optional | `"resp"` | Only `"resp"` is supported. |
| `[parameterization].forcefield` | optional | `"gaff2"` | Amber/GAFF atom typing passed to AmberTools. |
| `[parameterization].amber_forcefield` | optional | `"gaff2"` | Legacy alias for force-field selection. |
| `[amber].forcefield` | optional | `"gaff2"` | Also accepted; values in `[parameterization]` override `[amber]`. |
| `[qm].basis` or `[qm.geometry].basis` | optional | `"6-31g(d)"` | Basis for PySCF geometry optimization. |
| `[qm].maxsteps` or `[qm.geometry].maxsteps` | optional | `100` | Maximum geometry optimization steps. |
| `[qm].classical_preopt` | optional | `false` | If true, RDKit MMFF/UFF conformer pre-optimization is run before QM optimization. |
| `[qm].classical_conformers` | optional | `20` | Number of RDKit conformers for classical pre-optimization; must be at least 1. |
| `[output].directory` | optional | `"cwd"` | `"cwd"` writes into the current working directory; `"library"` writes into `<libraries.dye_dir>/<code>/<forcefield>/`. |
| `[output].work_subdir` | optional | `"resp_fit"` | Subdirectory for RESP fitting intermediates. |
| `[output].cleanup` | optional | `"scratch"` | One of `"none"`, `"scratch"`, `"minimal"`, or `"library"`. `"library"` requires `output.directory = "library"`. |

Legacy `[dye]`, `[core]`, `[caps]`, `[charge]`, and `[amber]` shapes are still partly accepted by the parser, but new examples should use `[component]`, `[structure]`, `[parameterization]`, `[qm]`, and `[output]`.


## Generated Outputs

Final outputs include `<code>.mol2`, `<code>.frcmod`, and `<code>.attach`. Intermediate outputs can include `<name>.sdf`, `<name>.pdb`, `qm_opt/`, and the RESP working directory, depending on `[output].cleanup` settings. 

## How To Run

```bash
pyedna components create-dye dye.toml
```

If the config filename is omitted, PyeDNA uses `dye.toml` in the current directory:

```bash
pyedna components create-dye
```

On HPC systems, scheduler scripts may wrap this CLI command.

The scientific TOML file and CLI command are the same for CPU and GPU execution. Submit the job without GPU resources for CPU PySCF execution, or request a CUDA GPU through the scheduler to let PyeDNA use GPU4PySCF automatically when the validated GPU stack is installed.

## Common Modifications Or Advanced Options

Use `output.cleanup = "none"` when debugging parameterization. Use `output.directory = "library"` only after confirming the generated files should become reusable library inputs.

## Limitations / Troubleshooting

Only RESP charge fitting is supported. The cap fragment must currently contain one atom. Existing library output directories are not overwritten.
