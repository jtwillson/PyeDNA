# Analyze Amber Trajectory (`analyze_traj`)

## Purpose

`analyze_traj` analyzes an Amber trajectory using the hierarchy in order to post-process especially geneated ensembles of dye molecules relative to one another classically as well as quantum-mechanically.

## What the Workflow Does

PyeDNA loads the topology and trajectory, validates the requested frame interval, creates an output run directory, copies the config, and writes a manifest. For each frame, it extracts capped dye snapshots for each attachment, builds configured groups, runs classical jobs, runs quantum jobs, computes quantum and classical interactions, and appends JSONL output records.

## Prerequisites

- Amber topology file.
- Amber NetCDF trajectory file.
- `libraries.dye_dir` set so analysis can read dye MOL2 charge data and `.attach` metadata.
- `resid_mapping.json` available in the working directory when attachment residues need to map back to Amber dye residues. This file is produced by the `finalize` stage of `create_structure` as `./resid_mapping.json`.
- PySCF when quantum jobs are requested with the PySCF backend.
- Optional: CuPy and GPU4PySCF for GPU-accelerated PySCF execution when a CUDA GPU is visible to the job.

## User Input Required

**Required:** trajectory files, frame interval, dye attachments, group definitions, and requested calculations.

We first need to make sure `analyze_traj` reads in the `[[attachments]]` properly that have been done initially when creating the DNA/dye structure from some `structure.toml`.

> **Loading Attachment Information**
>
> In order to load information about dyes attached to the DNA structure, one needs to mirror the same structure of `[[attachments]]` as used for `structure.toml` in the `create_structure` workflow, i.e. chose the `libraries.dye_dir` codename for the `dye` and **importantly**, as `residue` the DNA residue from the `structure.toml` that we have used to attach the dye in the original (raw) DNA `.pdb` file (e.g. from `libraries.dna_dir`).
> **Note**: The residue IDs of the initial (raw) DNA `.pdb` and the Amber MD input `.pdb` differ by the simple reason that one nucleotide is replaces by one dye and two linker residues, i.e. each `[[attachment]]` in `structure.toml` increases the number of total residues by 2. 
> The mapping file that handles this confidently is `./resid_mapping.json`, so the user should **not delete** this file.

In order to perform analysis and computation on multiple dyes at once (most prominently if we want to do computations on a dye-dimer of neighboring dye molecules that are very close in space) one can group different residues, again specified by their residue IDs in `[[attachments]]`, to `[[groups]]`

> **Defining Groups**
>
> If one wants to perform computations on individual dyes molecules, one can define a group with `attachements = [resid]`.
> If one wants the group to include multiple dye molecules, one can specify e.g. `attachements = [resid1, resid2]`.
> The group `name` is important to reference with computation/analysis is supposed to be performed on the groups

Calculations are typically being performed **only** on pre-defined `[[groups]]`. Once such groups have been computed, one can decide which types of analyses one wants to perform on this group.

> **Specifying Computations**
>
> Analyses on `[[groups]]` can be either of classical (see blocks `[[classical]]`) or quantum (see blocks `[[quantum]]`) nature.
> Refer to the below specified keywords in order to see what exactly this can entail. Importantly, one needs to specify the correct group `name`. 

If one wants to back out quantities that emerge from computation outcomes between different `[[groups]]` one can use `[[interactions]]`.
The term interaction does *not* refer to some actual physcial interaction between groups but more to quantities that only make sense between different groups, e.g. electronic coupling and/or center-of-mass/geometry distance. 

> **Getting Group-to-Group Quantities (`[[interactions]]`)**
>
> There are both group-to-group computations for classical (see blocks `[[classical_interactions]]`) and quantum quantities (see blocks `[[quantum_interactions]]`) implemented. See documentation in table below for more details.
> One needs to specify `groups = [group_name1, group_name2]` in order to define which groups to consider.

## Configuration Reference

### `[trajectory]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `run_directory` | required | none | Directory containing the trajectory file, resolved relative to the current working directory. |
| `topology_file` | required | none | Amber topology file, resolved relative to the current working directory. |
| `trajectory_file` | required | none | Trajectory file within `run_directory`. |
| `frame_interval` | required | none | Two integers `[initial_frame, final_frame]`, inclusive. Start must be non-negative and final must be within the trajectory. |
| `optimize_caps` | optional | `[quantum_defaults].optimize_caps`, else `false` | If true, cap atoms appended to extracted dye snapshots are optimized with constrained DFT. |
| `basis` | optional | `[quantum_defaults].basis`, else `"6-31g"` | Basis used when building PySCF molecules for caps/groups. |

### `[[attachments]]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dye` | required | none | Dye name used to load `<libraries.dye_dir>/<dye>/gaff2/<dye>.mol2` and `<libraries.dye_dir>/<dye>/<dye>.attach`. |
| `residue` | required | none | Unique attachment residue identifier. Groups reference attachments by this integer. |
| `cap` | optional | `"H"` | Cap used when cutting the dye from the trajectory. Supported values are `"H"` and `"CH3"`; normalized to uppercase. |

Duplicate attachment residues are not allowed.

When the trajectory comes from the structure and MD workflows, the `pyedna structure finalize` stage writes `resid_mapping.json` in the working directory. That file records how the `residue` values specified in `structure.toml` under `[[attachments]]` map onto the final Amber residue numbering after each DNA residue is replaced by dye/linker residues. Use this mapping when deciding which attachment residues to list in `traj.toml`.

### `[[groups]]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | required | none | Unique group name. |
| `attachments` | required | none | Non-empty list of attachment residue IDs defined in `[[attachments]]`. |

Groups are built by combining the capped snapshot molecules for the listed attachments.

### `[[classical]]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `group` | required | none | Existing group name. |
| `outputs` | optional | none | Supported values are `axis_angle`, `center_of_geometry`, `center_of_mass`, and `radius_of_gyration`. |

### `[[quantum]]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `group` | required | none | Existing group name. |
| `method` | required | none | `"dft"` or `"tddft"`. |
| `backend` | optional | backend-specific default | `"pyscf"` or `"orca"`. |
| `basis` | optional | backend-specific default | Quantum basis string. |
| `xc` | optional | backend-specific default | DFT exchange-correlation functional. |
| `charge` | optional | inferred from built group unless backend/job overrides | Integer molecular charge. |
| `spin` | optional | backend default | Integer spin. |
| `nstates` | optional | backend default | Positive integer number of states. |
| `state_ids` | optional | backend default | Contiguous zero-based state IDs such as `[0, 1, 2]`. |
| `outputs` | optional | `[]` | Supported outputs include `energies`, `excited_state_energies`, `excitation_energies`, `oscillator_strengths`, `transition_dipoles`, `transition_quadrupoles`, `transition_density_matrices`, `tdm`, `strongest_state`, `mulliken`, `mulliken_populations`, `mulliken_charges`, `opa`, and `orbital_participation`. |
| `gpu`, `density_fit`, `tda`, `singlet` | optional | backend-specific defaults | Boolean quantum settings. `gpu` is deprecated; CPU/GPU execution is selected from visible runtime resources. |
| `scf_cycles`, `verbosity` | optional | backend-specific defaults | Integer quantum settings. |

Values in `[quantum_defaults]` are copied into each `[[quantum]]` job unless that job sets the field directly. `optimize_caps` is also accepted here as a trajectory construction default, but is not copied into individual `[[quantum]]` jobs.

### `[quantum_defaults]`

Use `[quantum_defaults]` for quantum settings that should apply to all `[[quantum]]` jobs, such as `backend`, `basis`, `xc`, `density_fit`, `tda`, `singlet`, `nstates`, `scf_cycles`, or `verbosity`. Job-specific values in an individual `[[quantum]]` block override the defaults. `basis` and `optimize_caps` can also provide defaults for capped molecule and group construction unless `[trajectory]` sets them explicitly.

```toml
[quantum_defaults]
backend = "pyscf"
basis = "6-31g"
xc = "b3lyp"
density_fit = true
optimize_caps = false
```

### Interactions

Interactions are quantities computed between two groups, such as a distance between two dye groups or an electronic coupling between two quantum-calculated groups. In this context, "interaction" does not mean a force-field nonbonded interaction term; it means a requested group-to-group analysis result.

`[[interactions]]` is accepted as a generic legacy-style table and is normalized into quantum or classical interactions based on `type`.

| Table | Type | Required fields | Optional fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[[classical_interactions]]` | `"distance"` | exactly two `groups` or at least two `attachments` | `method = "center_of_geometry"` or `"center_of_mass"` |
| `[[quantum_interactions]]` | `"coupling"` | exactly two `groups` or at least two `attachments` | `method = "tdm"`, `state_pairs`, `coupling_type = "electronic"`, `"cJ"`, or `"cK"` |

Interactions must define exactly one of `groups` or `attachments`. Coupling interactions can request state pairs containing non-negative integers or `"strongest"`.

### `[analysis]`, `[analysis.units]`, `[analysis.save]`, `[output]`, and `[quantum_scheduler]`

| Field | Required | Default | Meaning and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[analysis].output_root` | optional | `"analysis"` | Root output directory. |
| `[analysis].name` | optional | `"auto"` | Output run directory name; `"auto"` creates a timestamped name. |
| `[analysis.units].energy` | optional | `"eV"` | One of `"hartree"`, `"au"`, `"e_h"`, `"eV"`, or `"cm-1"`; validation is case-insensitive for supported units. |
| `[analysis.units].coupling` | optional | `"cm-1"` | Same supported values as energy. |
| `[analysis.units].distance` | optional | `"angstrom"` | One of `"angstrom"`, `"a"`, `"bohr"`, or `"nm"`. |
| `[analysis.save].save_intermediates` | optional | backend-specific behavior | Must be boolean if present. |
| `[output].quantum_file` | optional | `"quantum.jsonl"` | Quantum results filename. |
| `[output].classical_file` | optional | `"classical.jsonl"` | Classical results filename. |
| `[output].quantum_interactions_file` | optional | `"quantum_interactions.jsonl"` | Quantum interaction results filename. |
| `[output].classical_interactions_file` | optional | `"classical_interactions.jsonl"` | Classical interaction results filename. |
| `[output].interaction_file` | optional | quantum interactions legacy alias | Used when `quantum_interactions_file` is absent. |
| `[quantum_scheduler].parallel` | optional | `false` | If true, independent quantum jobs within one frame may run concurrently. |
| `[quantum_scheduler].gpu_ids` | optional | inferred from visible GPUs | Deprecated advanced override. Non-empty list of visible GPU IDs. |
| `[quantum_scheduler].max_workers` | optional | GPU: visible GPU count; CPU: `1` | Positive integer advanced override for concurrent quantum worker processes. |

## How To Run The Workflow

Run the workflow directly with:

```bash
pyedna analysis trajectory traj.toml
```

If the config filename is omitted, PyeDNA uses `traj.toml` in the current directory:

```bash
pyedna analysis trajectory
```

On HPC systems, use the sample scheduler wrapper:

```bash
sbatch jobs/analysis/analyze_traj.sh traj.toml
```

Edit the `#SBATCH` resource lines in `jobs/analysis/analyze_traj.sh` for the resources you want to allocate on your cluster. Keep `traj.toml` focused on trajectory, group, classical, and quantum-analysis settings.

## CPU/GPU Resource Selection

`traj.toml` stores scientific analysis settings only. It should not need `gpu = true` or `gpu_ids = [...]` just to mirror the SLURM allocation. The example [jobs/analysis/analyze_traj.sh](../../jobs/analysis/analyze_traj.sh) script requests SLURM resources, then runs the same command:

```bash
pyedna analysis trajectory "$@"
```

Choose CPU or GPU execution by changing the script's `#SBATCH` resource lines:

```bash
# CPU
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
```

```bash
# GPU
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
```

At runtime, PyeDNA inspects `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and SLURM variables such as `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, `SLURM_JOB_GPUS`, `SLURM_GPUS`, and `SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE`. If no CUDA GPU is visible, cap optimization and DFT/TDDFT run with plain CPU PySCF. If one or more GPUs are visible, PyeDNA uses GPU4PySCF for PySCF-backed cap optimization and DFT/TDDFT.

For quantum analysis, `[quantum_scheduler].parallel = true` allows independent quantum jobs within one frame to run concurrently. In GPU mode, the default is one quantum worker per visible GPU. In CPU mode, the default is one quantum worker so each PySCF calculation can use the allocated CPU threads without accidental oversubscription. Use `[quantum_scheduler].max_workers` only as an advanced override.

## Generated Outputs

The default output directory is:

```text
analysis/analysis_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM/
```

Outputs include:

- `traj.toml`: copy of the analysis configuration used for the run.
- `manifest.json`: run metadata, trajectory input paths, units, output file paths, requested interactions, and quantum job summaries.
- `classical.jsonl`: one JSON object per classical result, with `frame`, `group`, and a `values` object containing requested quantities such as `center_of_geometry`, `center_of_mass`, or `radius_of_gyration`.
- `quantum.jsonl`: one JSON object per quantum result, with `frame`, `group`, `method`, `atom_count`, `charge`, `spin`, and, for TDDFT jobs, a nested `tddft` object containing requested outputs such as excited-state energies, oscillator strengths, transition dipoles, transition density matrices, or strongest-state information.
- `classical_interactions.jsonl`: one JSON object per classical group-to-group interaction result, with `frame`, `type`, `method`, `groups`, and a `values` object such as `distance`.
- `quantum_interactions.jsonl`: one JSON object per quantum group-to-group interaction result, with `frame`, `type`, `method`, `groups`, `state_pair`, and a `values` object containing coupling quantities.

The `.jsonl` files use JSON Lines format: each line is an independent JSON object. This makes the files easy to append during long analyses and straightforward to load into tabular tools later.

As a rough shape check, the number of records is normally:

| File | Expected number of records |
| --- | --- |
| `classical.jsonl` | number of analyzed frames x number of `[[classical]]` jobs |
| `quantum.jsonl` | number of analyzed frames x number of `[[quantum]]` jobs |
| `classical_interactions.jsonl` | number of analyzed frames x number of `[[classical_interactions]]` jobs |
| `quantum_interactions.jsonl` | number of analyzed frames x number of `[[quantum_interactions]]` jobs x number of requested `state_pairs`; one `[0, 0]` pair is used when `state_pairs` is omitted |

Nested arrays and dictionaries are kept as JSON values in the raw files. When loaded through PyeDNA's helper functions, scalar lists are flattened into numbered dataframe columns. See [Loading Analysis Results](loading_results.md).

> **Important**
>
> GPU trajectory quantum analysis requires the validated CUDA/CuPy/GPU4PySCF stack. CPU trajectory quantum analysis requires PySCF only.

The ORCA backend name is accepted by configuration validation, but the current ORCA backend raises `NotImplementedError` at runtime.

## Common Modifications Or Advanced Options

Use `[quantum_defaults]` to avoid repeating backend, basis, functional, or TDDFT settings across quantum jobs. Use interactions to request derived distances or couplings between groups.

## Limitations / Troubleshooting

Attachment/group definitions are strict: groups reference attachment residues directly, and duplicate attachment residues are rejected. The analysis code currently loads dye charge and attach metadata from the `gaff2` dye library path.

## Migration Note

The current supported analysis entry point is TOML-driven `analyze_traj`. Older analysis scripts and ad hoc parameter formats have been removed in favor of `pyedna.analysis` and `pyedna.trajectory`.
